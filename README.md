Vimflowy: Vim shortcuts for Dynalist
=====================================

This extension adds (some) VIM keyboard shortcuts to Workflowy.com.

These keyboard shortcuts are similar, if not identical, in their behaviour to the ones that can be found in the text editor called VIM. All VIM behaviours are not supported yet. New shortcuts are continously added.

Keybindings
-----------

Vimflowy will block keystrokes which haven't been bound in all modes - except insert mode. However, keys that have been modified with ALT/CTRL/META (but not SHIFT) are allowed to passthrough. For example `<Shift>d` will be blocked but `<Ctrl>d` or `<alt>d` will be allowed to pass through.

Mode indicator
--------------

In the bottom left corner there is a mode indicator that shows what mode you are in currently.

Rebinding keys
--------------

You'll have to edit [keybinding.js](https://github.com/Wojnach/vimflowy/blob/master/keybindings.js) or [transparentKeybindings.js](https://github.com/Wojnach/vimflowy/blob/master/transparentKeybindings.js) if you want to rebind or add new shortcuts.

mac users: if you want to bind stuff to Cmd you'll have to type "meta-" instead. "meta-j" instead of "cmd-j" for example.

----------

If you're using [cvim](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cvim/ihlenndgcmojhcghmfjfneahoeklbjjh) (or any other Chrome extensions that install modal keybindings), make sure you add `http*://*.workflowy.com/*`to the excluded URLs.
